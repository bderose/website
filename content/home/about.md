# Biography

I am a former PhD student of [Ken Goldberg](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) in the [Berkeley AUTOLab](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/) and [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). My research spanned topics including distributed cloud robotics, optimization for statistical learning, and optimal design in machine learning model hyperparameter search experiments.

Prior to my time in Berkeley, I studied [math](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics)
and [cs](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/computer-science) at Pomona College and worked
on the [Analysis and Experimentation](http://exp-platform.com/) team at Microsoft.

I am currently a Staff Engineer building machine learning algorithms which power PayPal's retail personalization and recommender systems for merchants.
